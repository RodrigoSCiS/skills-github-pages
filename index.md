# **Biography**
1. I lived in Madrid until I was 18 years old. Throughout these years, I went to school, did the national and international baccaulearates and found out my love for Mathematics. 
2. After school I went on to England with the purpose of studying an Integrated Master´s Degree in Mathematics at the University of Lancaster. My dissertation on Brownian Motion and the Dirichlet Problem achieved the best consideration among all undergraduates, and as such I was invited to compete in the North West Branch Celebration of Mathematics organized by the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications for the best dissertation in the North West of England. I ended third in the competition. In addition, my grade transcript was the fifth best from my degree. 
3. Upon finishing my mathematics degree, I went on to study a Masters in Artificial Intelligence in the University of Edinburgh. There I worked during my dissertation with Dr. Sohan Seth on a project from the university in collaboration with the United Nations to perform Census-Independent Population Estimation with low-cost, low-resolution Satellite Imagery. My dissertation achieved a *first* classification.
4. Nowadays I work in the intersection between Information Security and Artificial Intelligence.
